# Ghostly Light

Ghostly light is a small toy project powered by a coin cell, which is inspired by the ghosts of the classic pacman game.
This small toy consists of a plastic shell designed to be 3d-printed, a specific hardware, and a software that generates the different effects.
The plastic shell has the shape of a pacman ghost. It consists of two parts, which allows you to remove the PCB and change the battery. It''s recommended to print in translucent neutral color to get a better finish.
The hardware consists of a low power step-up, an ATtiny85 microcontroller and an WS2812B addressable LED. All the pins of the microcontroller are exposed in a header, which makes this PCB also ideal as a development environment for this microcontroller.
When the toy is turned on, it will randomly choose one of the four pacman ghosts. Once (automatically) selected, it will show different animations over time, which are also randomized. The toy does not require any type of interaction with the user, being ideal as a decorative element.

## Dedication:

> This project was originally conceived as a gift to my friend Isi, and developed as a thank-you present.
> Still, you're free to reuse this project for whatever you want, even if it's as shabby as decorative lights or as a gift to other people, knowing they'll never be as cool as my good friend. If you are only going to use the hardware of this project as a development environment for your own applications, make sure they are inclusive and creative. Do it for my friend. Thank you and happy hacking.
